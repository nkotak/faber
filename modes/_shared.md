# System Context -- faber

<!-- ============================================================
     THIS FILE IS AUTO-UPDATABLE. Don't put personal data here.
     
     Your customizations go in modes/_profile.md (never auto-updated).
     This file contains system rules, scoring logic, and tool config
     that improve with each faber release.
     ============================================================ -->

## Sources of Truth

| File | Path | When |
|------|------|------|
| cv.md | `cv.md` (project root) | ALWAYS |
| article-digest.md | `article-digest.md` (if exists) | ALWAYS (detailed proof points) |
| profile.yml | `config/profile.yml` | ALWAYS (candidate identity and targets) |
| _profile.md | `modes/_profile.md` | ALWAYS (user archetypes, narrative, negotiation) |

**RULE: NEVER hardcode metrics from proof points.** Read them from cv.md + article-digest.md at evaluation time.
**RULE: For article/project metrics, article-digest.md takes precedence over cv.md.**
**RULE: Read _profile.md AFTER this file. User customizations in _profile.md override defaults here.**

## Scoring System

The evaluation uses 6 blocks (A-F) with a global score of 1-5:

| Dimension | What it measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Match con CV | Skills, experience, proof points alignment |
| North Star alignment | How well the role fits the user's target archetypes (from _profile.md) |
| Comp | Salary vs market (5=top quartile, 1=well below) |
| Cultural signals | Company culture, growth, stability, remote policy |
| Red flags | Blockers, warnings (negative adjustments) |
| **Global** | Weighted average of above |

**Score interpretation:**
- 4.5+ → Strong match, recommend applying immediately
- 4.0-4.4 → Good match, worth applying
- 3.5-3.9 → Decent but not ideal, apply only if specific reason
- Below 3.5 → Recommend against applying (see Ethical Use in CLAUDE.md)

## Archetype Detection

Classify every offer into one of these types (or hybrid of 2):

| Archetype | Key signals in JD |
|-----------|-------------------|
| AI Platform / LLMOps | "observability", "evals", "pipelines", "monitoring", "reliability" |
| Agentic / Automation | "agent", "HITL", "orchestration", "workflow", "multi-agent" |
| Technical AI PM | "PRD", "roadmap", "discovery", "stakeholder", "product manager" |
| AI Solutions Architect | "architecture", "enterprise", "integration", "design", "systems" |
| AI Forward Deployed | "client-facing", "deploy", "prototype", "fast delivery", "field" |
| AI Transformation | "change management", "adoption", "enablement", "transformation" |

After detecting archetype, read `modes/_profile.md` for the user's specific framing and proof points for that archetype.

## Global Rules

### NEVER

1. Invent experience or metrics
2. Modify cv.md or portfolio files
3. Submit applications on behalf of the candidate
4. Share phone number in generated messages
5. Recommend comp below market rate
6. Generate a PDF without reading the JD first
7. Use corporate-speak
8. Ignore the tracker (every evaluated offer gets registered)

### ALWAYS

0. **Cover letter:** If the form allows it, ALWAYS include one. Same visual design as CV. JD quotes mapped to proof points. 1 page max.
1. Read cv.md, _profile.md, and article-digest.md (if exists) before evaluating
1b. **First evaluation of each session:** Run `node cv-sync-check.mjs`. If warnings, notify user.
2. Detect the role archetype and adapt framing per _profile.md
3. Cite exact lines from CV when matching
4. Use WebSearch for comp and company data
5. Register in tracker after evaluating
6. Generate content in the language of the JD (EN default)
7. Be direct and actionable -- no fluff
8. Native tech English for generated text. Short sentences, action verbs, no passive voice.
8b. Case study URLs in the PDF Header contact row (recruiters scan top-down; the header is read first). The Professional Summary section was removed 2026-04 — never render one.
9. **Tracker additions as TSV** -- NEVER edit applications.md directly. Write TSV in `batch/tracker-additions/`.
10. **Include `**URL:**` in every report header.**

### Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| `node fetch-jd.mjs {URL}` | **Preferred JD extraction** — Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever via JSON API (~200ms, parallel-safe). Exits non-zero if not API-supported. |
| agent-browser CLI | JD extraction fallback for non-API URLs (Workday, custom careers). Parallel-safe — independent Chrome instances. |
| Playwright MCP | Offer verification + interactive single-agent JD extraction. **NEVER 2+ agents with Playwright MCP in parallel — shared browser instance.** |
| WebFetch | JD extraction fallback for static HTML pages. |
| WebSearch | Comp research, trends, company culture, LinkedIn contacts, last-resort JD discovery via secondary portals. |
| Read | cv.md, _profile.md, article-digest.md, cv-template.html |
| Write | Temporary HTML for PDF, applications.md, reports .md |
| Edit | Update tracker |
| Canva MCP | Optional visual CV generation. Duplicate base design, edit text, export PDF. Requires `canva_resume_design_id` in profile.yml. |
| Bash | `node generate-pdf.mjs` |

### Time-to-offer priority
- Working demo + metrics > perfection
- Apply sooner > learn more
- 80/20 approach, timebox everything

## Professional Writing & ATS Compatibility

These rules apply to ALL generated text that ends up in candidate-facing documents: PDF summaries, bullets, cover letters, form answers, LinkedIn messages. They do NOT apply to internal evaluation reports.

### Use the prose-discipline skill

All user-facing prose must follow the rules in `.claude/skills/prose-discipline/`. Read `SKILL.md` and `references/anti-patterns.md` before drafting. Run the validator after drafting:

```bash
node .claude/skills/prose-discipline/scripts/validate-prose.mjs <file>
```

Fix every flagged violation before saving. The skill enforces the 19 anti-patterns (em-dashes, contrast framing, engagement bait, grand-synthesis phrases, broad comparative claims, polished adjectives, slogan endings, etc.) plus a 20-phrase blacklist.

In addition to the prose-discipline rules, also avoid these older cliché phrases (kept here for ATS-keyword guidance, not voice):

- "passionate about" / "results-oriented" / "proven track record" / "leveraged" / "spearheaded" / "facilitated" / "synergies" / "robust" / "seamless" / "innovative" / "in today's fast-paced world" / "demonstrated ability to" / "best practices".

### Unicode normalization for ATS

`generate-pdf.mjs` automatically normalizes em-dashes, smart quotes, and zero-width characters to ASCII equivalents for maximum ATS compatibility. But the prose-discipline validator (Rule 3) catches them at draft time so they never reach the renderer.

### Prefer specifics over abstractions

- "Cut p95 latency from 2.1s to 380ms" beats "improved performance"
- "Postgres + pgvector for retrieval over 12k docs" beats "designed scalable RAG architecture"
- Name tools, projects, and customers when allowed
